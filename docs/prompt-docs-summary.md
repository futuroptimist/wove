- **Codex Automation Prompt** (`evergreen`) — `docs/prompts/codex/automation.md`
  This document stores the baseline prompt used when instructing OpenAI Codex (or compatible
  agents) to contribute to the Wove repository. Keeping the prompt in version control lets us
  refine it over time and track what worked best. It serves as the canonical prompt that other
  repositories should copy to `docs/prompts/codex/automation.md` for consistent automation. For
  propagation instructions, see propagate.md.

- **Codex CAD Prompt** (`evergreen`) — `docs/prompts/codex/cad.md`
  Use this prompt when generating or updating OpenSCAD modules for Wove. It keeps 3D assets and
  their exported models in sync.

- **Codex Design Doc Upgrade Prompt** (`evergreen`) — `docs/prompts/codex/design-doc-upgrade.md`
  Use this prompt when design specifications (like `docs/wove-v1c-design.md`) need structural
  improvements, simplification, or clarity before downstream teams execute on them.

- **Codex Docs Prompt** (`evergreen`) — `docs/prompts/codex/docs.md`
  Use this prompt when updating or creating documentation in Wove. It keeps written guides and
  references consistent.

- **Codex Implement Prompt** (`evergreen`) — `docs/prompts/codex/implement.md`
  Use this prompt when you want an automated agent to deliver a production-ready feature that
  has been promised but not yet built in the Wove project.

- **Wove Codex Polish Plan** (`unspecified`) — `docs/prompts/codex/polish.md`
  No description provided.

- **Codex Prompt Propagation Guide** (`evergreen`) — `docs/prompts/codex/propagate.md`
  Use this guide when copying Wove's Codex prompt catalog into another repository or rotating a
  fresh automation setup. It documents the lightweight checklist for keeping prompt docs
  synchronized with downstream projects.

- **Codex Test Prompt** (`evergreen`) — `docs/prompts/codex/tests.md`
  Use this prompt when adding or improving tests for Wove to ensure changes are well validated.
