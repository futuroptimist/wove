# Robotic Knitting Machine Overview

The long-term goal of this project is to develop a DIY robotic system that automates knitting. Components are modeled in OpenSCAD and live in the `cad/` directory.

## Planned Modules
- **Needle adapter** – holds a standard needle and connects to a stepper-driven carriage.
- **Stepper mount** – secures a motor for precise control.
- **Carriage** – moves the working yarn and needles and includes a center hole for mounting hardware.
- **Spacer** – maintains consistent gaps between components.

Generated G-code or custom instructions will drive these parts to knit automatically.
