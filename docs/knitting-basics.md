# Knitting Basics

This guide introduces the fundamentals of hand knitting with two standard needles.

## Materials
- A pair of straight knitting needles
- Worsted-weight yarn

## First Steps
1. **Cast on** a row of stitches.
2. Practice the **knit stitch** to create a simple fabric.
3. Learn the **purl stitch** to add texture.
4. **Bind off** to finish your piece.

Continue experimenting with gauge and patterns as you grow more comfortable.
