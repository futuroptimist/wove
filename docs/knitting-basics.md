# Knitting Basics

This guide introduces the fundamentals of hand knitting with two standard
needles.

## Materials
- A pair of straight knitting needles
- Worsted-weight yarn

## First Steps
1. **Cast on** a row of stitches.
2. Practice the **knit stitch** to create a simple fabric.
3. Learn the **purl stitch** to add texture.
4. **Bind off** to finish your piece.

## Gauge

Gauge measures how many stitches and rows fit within a set space. Matching
gauge keeps your project from finishing too large or too small.

1. Cast on enough stitches to form a square about four inches across.
2. Knit in the project's stitch until the fabric reaches four inches tall.
3. Count stitches and rows inside the square to compare with pattern numbers.

```python
from wove import stitches_per_inch

stitches_per_inch(20, 4)  # 5.0 stitches per inch
```
