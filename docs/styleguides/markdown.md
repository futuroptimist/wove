# Markdown Style Guide

Follow these rules to keep our docs consistent:

- Wrap lines at 100 characters or fewer.
- Use fenced code blocks with language tags when including code.
- Prefer relative links to documents within the repository.
- Use sentence case for headings and link titles.
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files` to check spelling and links before committing.
