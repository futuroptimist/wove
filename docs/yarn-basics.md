# Yarn Basics

Selecting the right yarn is key to successful knitting and crochet projects. This page
introduces common yarn weights and fiber types to help beginners choose materials.

## Yarn Weights

Yarn weight describes the thickness of a strand. Standard categories include:

- **Lace**: ultra fine yarn for delicate shawls.
- **Fingering**: lightweight yarn for socks and baby garments.
- **Sport**: slightly thicker yarn suited for lightweight sweaters.
- **DK (double knitting)**: versatile weight for many garments and accessories.
- **Worsted**: medium weight yarn commonly used for sweaters and blankets.
- **Bulky**: thick yarn that knits up quickly for warm items.

## Fiber Types

Fiber content affects texture, warmth, and care requirements:

- **Wool**: warm, resilient, and widely available.
- **Cotton**: cool, absorbent, and machine washable.
- **Acrylic**: budget friendly and easy to care for.
- **Blends**: combine fibers to balance softness, strength, and price.

When in doubt, check the yarn label for recommended needle size and gauge to match your
pattern.
