## Choose Your Path

Pick a starting point based on your current focus, then weave both tracks together as projects
advance.

- **Hand-Craft Track** – Build confidence with [knitting fundamentals](knitting-basics.md),
  [crochet techniques](crochet-basics.md), and [gauge exploration](gauge.md). Use these guides to
  practice stitches, measure fabric, and prepare swatches before introducing automation.
- **Automation Track** – Dive into motion planning with the [pattern CLI](pattern-cli.md), study the
  [mechanical crochet roadmap](wove-v1c-design.md), and reference the [robotic knitting machine
  specification](robotic-knitting-machine.md). Combine these resources with the Hand-Craft Track to
  validate yarn handling and safety limits on real hardware.
