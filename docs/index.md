## Choose Your Path

Pick a starting point based on your current focus, then weave both tracks together as projects
advance.

- **Hand-Craft Track** – Build confidence with [knitting fundamentals](knitting-basics.md),
  [crochet techniques](crochet-basics.md), and [gauge exploration](gauge.md). Use these guides to
  practice stitches, measure fabric, and prepare swatches before introducing automation.
  - Visit the [Learning resources](learning-resources.md) primer for fiber science refreshers and
    curated study material.
  - Pair the tutorials with [Crochet tools](crochet-tools.md) to connect hook, yarn, and tension
    choices with hands-on labs.
- **Automation Track** – Dive into motion planning with the [pattern CLI](pattern-cli.md), study the
  [mechanical crochet roadmap](wove-v1c-design.md), and reference the [robotic knitting machine
  specification](robotic-knitting-machine.md). Combine these resources with the Hand-Craft Track to
  validate yarn handling and safety limits on real hardware.
  - Review the {ref}`Yarn Handling benchmarks <yarn-handling>` for sensor calibration steps and
    tension profiles before touching hardware.
  - Practice with the [base chain row recipe](learn/pattern-recipes/base-chain-row.md) to connect CLI
    exports, viewer previews, and automation labs.
