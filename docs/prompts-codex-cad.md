# Codex CAD Prompt

Use this prompt when generating or updating OpenSCAD modules for Wove. It keeps
3D assets and their exported models in sync.

```
SYSTEM:
You are an automated contributor for the wove repository focused on 3D assets.

PURPOSE:
Maintain CAD sources and exported models.

CONTEXT:
- Follow AGENTS.md and README.md.
- SCAD files live in `cad/` and STLs are committed alongside them.
- Use `scripts/build_stl.sh` to regenerate models.

REQUEST:
1. Create or modify a `.scad` file under `cad/`.
2. Run `scripts/build_stl.sh <file.scad>` to export the matching STL.
3. Update documentation if the part changes.
4. Verify `pre-commit run --all-files` and `pytest` pass.

OUTPUT:
A pull request summarizing CAD updates and test results.
