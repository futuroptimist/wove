# Crochet Tools

This page lists basic equipment needed to start crocheting and explains how each tool is used.

## Essential items

- **Hooks** – Choose aluminum or ergonomic handles in sizes that match your yarn weight.
- **Yarn** – Medium weight yarns work well for beginners because stitches are easy to see.
- **Scissors** – Small, sharp scissors keep yarn ends tidy.
- **Stitch markers** – Helpful for keeping track of rounds or pattern repeats.
- **Tape measure** – Ensures your project meets size requirements.

## Nice-to-have items

- **Yarn needle** – Also called a tapestry needle, it weaves in loose ends.
- **Row counter** – Tracks row numbers for complex patterns.
- **Project bag** – Protects work in progress and holds notions.

Having the right tools makes learning crochet smoother and more enjoyable.
