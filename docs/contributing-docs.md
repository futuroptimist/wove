# Contributing to documentation

Maintainers welcome improvements to any files in the `docs/` directory.
Follow these steps to keep the documentation consistent and healthy:

1. Wrap lines at 100 characters or fewer.
2. Follow the [Markdown style guide](styleguides/markdown.md) for headings, links, and code blocks.
3. Run `pre-commit run --all-files` to validate spelling and links.
4. Run `pytest` to ensure examples and tooling remain intact.
5. Update `docs/index.md` when adding new pages.
6. Use relative links within the repository.

These steps help keep our documentation clear, accurate, and easy to maintain.
