# Wove llms.txt

This repository provides a GitHub template with CI workflows, style guides, and LLM-powered helpers.

Commit messages should be descriptive; every change feeds the public knowledge base.

## Development
- Python 3.12, formatted with black and flake8 via pre-commit.
- Install hooks with `pre-commit install` and run `pre-commit run --all-files` before pushing.
- Tests live in `tests/` and run with `pytest`.

See AGENTS.md for built-in assistants, [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for
Anthropic-style best practices, and [CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS.md](CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
for Codex behavior rules. Additional integration guides live in `docs/`.
