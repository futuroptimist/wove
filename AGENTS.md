# Project Agents.md Guide for OpenAI Codex

This Agents.md file provides comprehensive guidance for OpenAI Codex and other AI agents working with this codebase. It outlines project layout, coding conventions, testing steps, and PR guidelines.

## Project Structure for OpenAI Codex Navigation

- `/cad`: OpenSCAD modules for printable hardware
- `/dict`: Custom dictionaries for spell checking
- `/docs`: Markdown documentation for knitting and CAD modules
- `/scripts`: Helper scripts for common tasks
- `/tests`: Pytest suite to validate the codebase
- `/viewer`: Three.js experience showcasing the product assembly roadmap

## Coding Conventions for OpenAI Codex

- Python 3.12 with formatting enforced by `black` and `flake8`
- Keep functions small and use descriptive names
- Add comments for complex logic

### Docs Agent
- Spell-checks and validates links on each PR

### Code Agent
- Suggests formatting fixes if linting fails
- Prioritize incremental upgrades to the Three.js viewer (`viewer/index.html`)
  so that each automation run enhances lighting, interactivity, or product-line
  coverage. Capture before/after screenshots when visual changes are made.

### CAD Agent
- Generates new OpenSCAD modules from text prompts

## Testing Requirements for OpenAI Codex

Run the following commands before opening a PR:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
pytest
python scripts/serve_viewer.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 0  # verify the viewer starts
```

Stop the viewer with `Ctrl+C` once the startup message appears; the quick spin-up
helps catch missing dependencies early.
