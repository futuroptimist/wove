**wove** aims to provide an open-source toolkit for learning to knit and crochet while
building toward a robotic knitting machine. Documentation in `docs/` covers hand
knitting and crochet basics, while the `cad/` directory contains OpenSCAD files for
printable hardware components.

Key features include:

- CI workflows for linting, testing, and docs previews.
- Pre-commit hooks with spell checking via `pyspelling`.
- Simple OpenSCAD scripts and STLs for hardware.
- Utility functions such as stitch and row gauge calculators for inches,
  centimeters, yards, and meters (for example, `stitches_per_yard` and
  `rows_per_meter`), width estimators from stitch counts across those units, and
  simple unit conversion helpers.
  See [docs/gauge.md](docs/gauge.md) for examples.
- A shared unit registry (`wove.units.UNIT_REGISTRY`) that keeps conversions
  between imperial and metric measurements consistent across gauge tools,
  tension analyzers, and motion planners.
- A pattern translation CLI (`python -m wove.pattern_cli`) that turns a simple
  stitch description into G-code-like motion for early crochet experiments. Use
  `--format planner` to export per-command position snapshots, bounds, and (when
  `--machine-profile` is provided) the axis metadata consumed by the
  browser-based planner roadmap. The planner defaults also surface the homing
  guard (`require_home`) and `home_state` captured during translation so
  downstream tools can prompt builders before running motion.
- Yarn tension profile helpers (`wove.tension`) that document tested pull
  forces, trial durations, and feed rates for lace through super bulky yarns.
  Use `find_tension_profile_for_wpi` to map wraps-per-inch measurements to the
  catalog, `find_tension_profile_for_force` to match measured pull force data,
  and the interpolation helpers `estimate_profile_for_wpi`,
  `estimate_profile_for_force`, and `estimate_profile_for_sensor_reading` to
  guide in-between yarn choices and translate hall-effect sensor readings into
  the same feed-rate and variation context. Call
  `estimate_sensor_reading_for_tension` to compute the hall-effect reading a
  servo-driven tensioner should target for a desired pull force.
- LLM helpers described in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
- Sample Codex prompts in [`docs/prompts/codex/automation.md`](docs/prompts/codex/automation.md).

## Visualize the Product Assembly

Kick the tires on the new Three.js assembly viewer to see how our product lines
fit together as the roadmap grows. The scene currently spotlights `v1c`, the
first crochet robot, and is designed for incremental upgrades as new Codex
tasks expand the experience. Hover the translucent workpiece support bed to see
where swatches land while the gantry executes calibration moves.

```bash
python scripts/serve_viewer.py
# open http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html in your browser
```

Each contribution should leave the viewer a little betterâ€”add new assets,
improve lighting, or enhance interactivityâ€”so that future operators can preview
the entire assembly from a browser. Hover the glowing emergency stop or the axis
end stops with their pulsing halos to see the safety interlocks called out in
the v1c roadmap. Each limit switch now emits a soft indicator light so the
homing path is easy to trace from above. The translucent polycarbonate shield
now wraps the gantry to mirror the production
enclosure described in the mechanical roadmapâ€”hover the door to read the
maintenance callout. Snap-on belt guards now clip over the CoreXY loops so stray
yarn or tools stay clear while operators inspect motion from above. Click a
product pedestal to spotlight its roadmap milestone, watch the glowing ring
pulse as it tracks which cluster is selected, and let the camera glide to frame
the scene. A teal sweep now orbits the
selected pedestal so the active milestone stays obvious from the plaza
overview. The plaza highlights these milestones today:

Mint-highlighted floor markings now extend through the open doorway with alternating, pulsing footprints so operators can practice each step without clipping the gantry or tension hardware. Numbered step badges hover above each marker so crews can rehearse the left/right cadence before approaching the enclosure.

Pulsing magnetic anchor pucks now mark the removable workpiece bed so crews can
practice swapping swatch plates into position before the gantry starts tracing
calibration paths.

Peek through the tinted electronics bay under the work bed to see the SKR Mini
controller stack, cooling fan, and glowing status LED that route motion power up
to the gantry.

Amber pulses now race through the translucent PTFE tube so you can watch yarn
flow from the spool, past the hall-effect sensor, and into the crochet hook as
the planner preview runs. Three glowing beads now chase along the same guide,
staggering their pace whenever the preview feeds yarn so the flow direction
stays obvious at a glanceâ€”even in still frames.

The source spool now spins in sync with yarn feed events so the hologram shows
fiber unwinding from the supply while the PTFE tube glows. When extrusion
pauses, the reel now coasts to a stop so idle previews keep the spool parked.
A shimmering Z-axis lift now hugs the hook carriage: the T8 leadscrew pulses
beside the gantry while the anti-backlash nut and printed flexures glow to show
how the carriage keeps vertical motion tight.

A glowing thermistor channel now traces the reserved wiring route for the
future heated bed accessory so teams can plan sensor hookups before the upgrade
lands.

The overlay now includes a Pattern Studio preview panel that cycles through the
current `wove.pattern_cli --format planner` comment while a progress bar tracks
the hologram run. Operators can cross-reference the displayed step with the
planner animation without leaving the scene. The viewer pulls its sample from
`viewer/assets/base_chain_row.planner.json`, the same planner export produced by
the CLI fixtures, so the hologram stays aligned with the documented base chain
row recipe. Automated tests compare that asset against `PatternTranslator`
output to flag drift whenever the CLI evolves.

The overlay's Planner Defaults list calls out the safe Z height, fabric plane,
row height, and feed-rate defaults from the planner export so operators can
validate the viewer preview against CLI settings before rehearsing motion.

A translucent planner bounds frame now wraps the hologram while the overlay
lists the X/Y/Z/E limits emitted by the planner payload so teams can confirm the
motion envelope before committing the sequence to hardware.

Live coordinates now accompany each planner step so technicians can confirm the
active `X`, `Y`, `Z`, and yarn-feed positions directly from the overlay while
the hologram advances.

The overlay also surfaces a **Machine Profile** panel that lists axis
microstepping, steps-per-millimeter, and travel ranges whenever planner exports
embed machine metadata via `--machine-profile`. Verify the browser preview is
aligned with the configured gantry before rehearsing motion sequences.

The new **Homing Guard** panel highlights whether the planner required a homed
machine and echoes the captured `home_state`. Green and amber tones flag when a
preview came from a verified homing cycle or needs attention so operators can
double-check the gantry status before executing the motion sequence. It now
echoes the live planner coordinates alongside those status lights so the safety
overlay tracks the same `X`, `Y`, `Z`, and yarn-feed snapshot as the Pattern
Studio panel.

- **v1c Crochet Robot** â€“ anchors the mechanical platform showcased at the
  center of the plaza.
- **Tension Lab** â€“ stages the hall-effect calibration rig that feeds future
  servo-driven yarn tensioners, complete with a prototype micro-servo adjuster
  pulsing on the bench.
- **Material Prep Pod** â€“ organizes yarn cones, prep bins, and inspection
  checklists so dye lots and weights are verified before automation runs.
- **Pattern Studio** â€“ previews the planner workspace that visualizes
  `wove.pattern_cli --format planner` exports directly in the browser and
  replays the base chain row hologram for pattern dry runs.
- **v1k Research Rig** â€“ teases the knitting successor with prototype rails,
  a modular carriage sled, and telemetry pods collecting load data for future
  toolheads.

## Choose Your Path

Wove supports two complementary learning tracks. Start where your goals align,
then cross over as projects grow.

- **Hand-Craft Track** â€“ Learn core techniques with
  [knitting basics](docs/knitting-basics.md),
  [crochet primers](docs/crochet-basics.md), and
  [gauge calculators](docs/gauge.md). These guides build the vocabulary and
  measurement skills needed before automating motion.
  - Explore the
    [Learning resources](docs/learning-resources.md) primer for fiber science
    refreshers and curated study material.
  - Pair the stitch walkthroughs with the
    [crochet tools guide](docs/crochet-tools.md) to connect hook, yarn, and
    tension decisions with classroom labs.
- **Automation Track** â€“ Explore the mechanical and software stack with the
  [pattern translation CLI](docs/pattern-cli.md),
  [mechanical design roadmap](docs/wove-v1c-design.md), and
  [robotic knitting specification](docs/robotic-knitting-machine.md). Pair these
  resources with the Hand-Craft Track to validate yarn handling, gauge, and
  safety considerations as the gantry evolves.
  - Review the
    [Yarn Handling benchmarks](docs/wove-v1c-design.md#yarn-handling) for hall
    sensor calibration guidance and tension profiles.
  - Run the
    [base chain row recipe](docs/learn/pattern-recipes/base-chain-row.md) to tie
    planner exports, viewer previews, and automation labs together.

# Pattern translation CLI

Use the companion CLI to convert a lightweight stitch description into
G-code-like motion suitable for early gantry experiments. Feed the CLI either a
file path or inline text:

```bash
python -m wove.pattern_cli pattern.txt
# or
python -m wove.pattern_cli --text "CHAIN 2\nSINGLE 1" --format json
```

Trace simple SVG sketches by passing a polyline or polygon. Adjust scale and offsets to fit your
workspace:

```bash
python -m wove.pattern_cli --svg sketch.svg --svg-scale 2 --svg-offset-x 10 --svg-offset-y 5
```

The DSL accepts commands such as `SLIP <count>`, `CHAIN <count>`, `SINGLE <count>`, `DOUBLE
<count>`, `MOVE <x> <y>`, `TURN [height]`, and `PAUSE <seconds>`. The output is
G-code-inspired: each stitch generates plunge, yarn-feed, raise, and travel
moves with comments so you can import the sequence into firmware or simulation
tools. Export the planner-oriented JSON format with `--format planner` and
validate it against [`docs/schema/pattern-cli.schema.json`](docs/schema/pattern-cli.schema.json)
to integrate with browser tooling or downstream automation.
